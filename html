            <h2>FICTION</h2>
                    <p>Fiction is the telling of stories which are not real.<br>More specifically, fiction is an imaginative form of narrative, one of the four basic rhetorical modes.<br> Although the word fiction is derived from the Latin fingo, fingere, finxi, fictum, "to form, create",<br>works of fiction need not be entirely imaginary and may include real people, places, and events.<br>Fiction may be either written or oral. Although not all fiction is necessarily artistic,<br>fiction is largely perceived as a form of art or entertainment.<br>The ability to create fiction and other artistic works is considered to be a fundamental aspect of human culture,<br>one of the defining characteristics of humanity.
